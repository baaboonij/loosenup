# loosenup
 An aesthetic program that runs an optical illusion of ellipses.

My first program 'PROJECT Loosen Up' concluded the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at university (2020), I have made extensive use of loops, shapes, rotations, translations, accelerative movement, changing colours, and much more. I created an optical illusion using small ellipses accelerating back and forth in a straight line from one end of another (larger) ellipse to the other. The acceleration of the small ellipses is coded using parameters with float variables representing velocity. I have also declared and initialised variables representing the speed at which the little balls move, as well as the time difference in which they travel relative to one another. I've created a help page that can be toggled using 'H' on your keyboard, and there are instructions on there on how you can interact with the illusion using arrow keys. Project Loosen Up radiates a very relaxing vibe, so I imported ambient music to play in the background while you interact with it to further highlight the theme of 'loosening up'. If you'd like to play with it too, you can access the code here. Enjoy!
